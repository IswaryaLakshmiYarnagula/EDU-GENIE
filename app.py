# To run this Flask app locally (for testing):
# 1. Save this code as app.py
# 2. Make sure you have Flask and Flask-CORS installed:
#    pip install Flask Flask-CORS
# 3. Run from your terminal: python app.py
#    (or for development with auto-reload: flask --app app run --debug)
# This will start the server, typically on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Run the app in debug mode for development purposes
    app.run(debug=True)
# Note: In production, set debug=False and configure a proper WSGI server.
# Ensure you have Flask and Flask-CORS installed in your environment:
# pip install Flask Flask-CORS
